[Room 1]
Your eyes open as the sound of the rooster's cry echoes through the sky.
It's morning.
Feeling well rested, you grab your stuff and leave the bedroom.

INNKEEPER: Good morning, sir. Today's the big day, right?
           I heard the king hired you to vanquish some foul beast.
           A dragon, was it?
           Those are quite fearsome... and dangerous!

YOU: Is that so?
[Path-to 2] Arrogant response
[Path-to 3] Humble response


[Room 2]
YOU: I kill dragons in my spare time.
     Getting a bit of gold from it is just a bonus.

That was a lie.
The truth is, you were only recently knighted; the king sent you to kill a dragon as your first duty.

INNKEEPER: Your spare time?! You knights are incredible!

YOU: That's right.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 3]
YOU: Indeed. This will be my first task as a knight.

INNKEEPER: Your first task? Against a dragon?!
           Well, don't die out there! That's bad for business!

YOU: My king sent me on this task; I do not plan on failing him.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 4]
YOU: It is time for me to depart.

INNKEEPER: Farewell!

You step outside and retrieve your horse.
You are in the town square.
From here, you can see various stores along the perimeter of the square.
In the center is a large statue of a goddess worshipped by the villagers.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 6] Examine statue
[Path-to 7] Leave village
