[Room 1]
Your eyes open as the sound of the rooster's cry echoes through the sky.
It's morning.
Feeling well rested, you grab your stuff and leave the bedroom.

INNKEEPER: Good morning, sir. Today's the big day, right?
           I heard the king hired you to vanquish some foul beast.
           A dragon, was it?
           Those are quite fearsome... and dangerous!

YOU: Is that so?
[Path-to 2] Arrogant response
[Path-to 3] Humble response


[Room 2]
YOU: I kill dragons in my spare time.
     Getting a bit of gold from it is just a bonus.

That was a lie.
The truth is, you were only recently knighted; the king sent you to kill a dragon as your first duty.

INNKEEPER: Your spare time?! You knights are incredible!

YOU: That's right.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 3]
YOU: Indeed. This will be my first task as a knight.

INNKEEPER: Your first task? Against a dragon?!
           Well, don't die out there! That's bad for business!

YOU: My king sent me on this task; I do not plan on failing him.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 4]
YOU: It is time for me to depart.

INNKEEPER: Farewell!

You step outside and retrieve your horse.
You are in the town square.
From here, you can see various stores along the perimeter of the square.
In the center is a large statue of a goddess worshipped by the villagers.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 6] Examine statue
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 5]
You step inside an armory. 
Swords, maces, lances, shields, helmets, and other shiny equipment line the shelves and walls.
A sleek steel sword catches your eye, but its price quickly makes you avert your gaze.
Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins to buy anything in here.
The king is only going to reward you after you have slain the dragon.
That sword is still in your mind though...
[Path-to 8] Persuade vendor
[Path-to 9] Return to town square


[Room 6]
You take a closer look at the statue, and you find that it resembles a woman you loved ages ago.
You remember how the dragon, Bushkin, ate her while you were away working, and how you decided to become a knight - to destroy every dragon you encountered.
You find yourself with a newfound vengeance, never more ready to slay a dragon in your life.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 7]
You set forth on your journey.
After hours of traveling, you find a small village.
[Path-to 13] Visit the village
[Path-to 14] Keep going


[Room 8]
YOU: Hello, sir!
     I'm about to slay the most dangerous dragon to step foot in this land.
     I will need your best sword to accomplish that.
     
You point at the sword you were eyeing.

VENDOR: Ah, yes. That's a nice sword, isn't it?
        It's going to cost you 50 gold coins.

YOU: Sir, I don't think you understand.
     I'm about to slay the deadliest dragon, Trumpkin.
     If I fail, it will come here and destroy this village as we know it.

VENDOR: Really now? Dragons don't usually come this far inland.
        I can't just give you this sword; a man needs gold to stay in business, you know.
        But it'll be a shame to see a knight like yourself become dragon food.
        Take this apple, it'll hold you over on your journey.

You begrudgingly accept the apple.
[Path-to 10] Leave the store


[Room 9]
You are back at town square.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 6] Examine statue
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 10]
You are back at town square.
[Path-to 11] Examine statue
[Path-to 12] Leave village


[Room 11]
You take a closer look at the statue, and you find that it resembles a woman you loved ages ago.
You remember how the dragon, Bushkin, ate her while you were away working, and how you decided to become a knight - to destroy every dragon you encountered.
You find yourself with a newfound vengeance, never more ready to slay a dragon in your life.
[Path-to 12] Leave village


[Room 12]
You set forth on your journey.
After hours of traveling, you find a small village.
[Path-to 15] Visit the village
[Path-to 16] Keep going


[Room 13]
You are leisurely riding your horse through the village, when you suddenly spot an elderly man sitting in front of an ancient looking hut.
[Path-to 17] Talk to him
[Path-to 14] Leave village


[Room 14]
You keep going until you realize how exhausted you are.
You try looking for a place to rest for the night, but when you look around, the only thing you see is trees.
[Path-to 18] Sleep on a tree branch
[Path-to 19] Keep going


[Room 15]
You are leisurely riding your horse through the village, when you suddenly spot an elderly man sitting in front of an ancient looking hut.
[Path-to 20] Talk to him
[Path-to 16] Leave village


[Room 16]
You keep going until you realize how exhausted you are.
You try looking for a place to rest for the night, but when you look around, the only thing you see is trees.
[Path-to 18] Sleep on a tree branch
[Path-to 19] Keep going


[Room 17]
You approach the elderly man.

YOU: Hello, Sir. I was wondering if you knew where I could find the dragon, Trumpkin. 
     I am on my way to slay him.

ELDERLY MAN: Ah yes. That old thing. Last I heard it, it was supposed to get here in about a day's time. 
             I too am on my way to slay him.

YOU: Sir, I don't think that a man in your state is capable of slaying the most horrendous dragon of these lands.

ELDERLY MAN: I may not be as strong as you, young knight, but I have many tricks up my sleeves.
             Now, you must be tired from your journey.
             Would you like a place to sleep for the night?
[Path-to 21] Yes please
[Path-to 19] No thank you


[Room 18]
You are sleeping comfortably in a tree branch, when all of the sudden you hear a crack.
The sudden noise forces your eyes wide open.
You see the fattest squirrel you have ever seen in your life in front of you, on your branch.
*SNAP*
The tree branch couldn’t hold both you and the squirrel, and you plummet to the ground, possibly breaking some bones.
You see the squirrel scurry off without a care in the world.
You are too injured to slay the dragon.
You admit defeat, and start on your ride back home.
GAME OVER (Type restart to try again) 


[Room 19]
You march on! Who needs sleep? Not you. Except that after some time your eyes start to close...
Next thing you know, you are on the ground, and your horse is nowhere to be found.
The horse must have seen a wild snake, and you didn’t react fast enough, and you fell and hit your head.
There is no way in which you can slay the dragon with a head concussion, and no horse.
You admit defeat, and start walking back home.
GAME OVER (Type restart to try again)   


[Room 20]
You approach the elderly man.

YOU: Hello, Sir. I was wondering if you knew where I could find the dragon, Trumpkin. 
     I am on my way to slay him.

ELDERLY MAN: Ah yes. That old thing. Last I heard it, it was supposed to get here in about a day's time. 
             I too am on my way to slay him.

YOU: Sir, I don't think that a man in your state is capable of slaying the most horrendous dragon of these lands.

ELDERLY MAN: I may not be as strong as you, young knight, but I have many tricks up my sleeves.
             Now, you must be tired from your journey.
             Would you like a place to sleep for the night?
[Path-to 22] Yes please
[Path-to 19] No thank you


[Room 21]
You wake up to find all of your equipment gone.
You look for the elderly man from the night before.
You can’t find him anywhere.
Without your armor, sword, and horse, you are unable to continue on your journey.
GAME OVER (Type restart to try again)


[Room 22]
Your stomach wakes you up in the middle of the night.
You remember you have that apple from the vendor, and so you get out of your makeshift bed.
You hear some shuffling outside and head outside to investigate.

The elderly man is trying to put your armor on.

YOU: Sir, what are you doing?
     That is my armor.

ELDERLY MAN: I know. You were right.
             I have a better chance of winning if I have better equipment.

YOU: Sir. You are not going to let you slay that dragon by yourself.
     At least, not in my gear.

ELDERLY MAN: I never said you couldn't join me.
             The dragon is supposed to pass by this village in less than an hour.

You lend your chestplate to the elderly man, keeping your helmet.
After you both get ready, you set forth to slay the dragon.

When you finally see it in front of you, you remember the woman you loved, and with that thought in mind you reach for your sword.
In your peripheral vision, you see the elderly man with twenty others, all with their own weapons. 
After hours of fighting, Trumpkin tumbles and falls down.

ELDERLY MAN: Give me your sword!

You couldn't help but to toss him your sword.
The elderly man swiftly removes Trumpkin's head from its body.

YOU: Sir, thank you for your help.
     By the way, I never got your name.

ELDERLY MAN: It's Sir Bernard.

Congratulations. You defeated the dragon.
