[Room 1]
Your eyes open as the sound of the rooster's cry echoes through the sky.
It's morning.
Feeling well rested, you grab your stuff and leave the bedroom.

INNKEEPER: Good morning, sir. Today's the big day, right?
           I heard the king hired you to vanquish some foul beast.
           A dragon, was it?
           Those are quite fearsome... and dangerous!

YOU: Is that so?
[Path-to 2] Arrogant response
[Path-to 3] Humble response


[Room 2]
YOU: I kill dragons in my spare time.
     Getting a bit of gold from it is just a bonus.

That was a lie.
The truth is, you were only recently knighted; the king sent you to kill a dragon as your first duty.

INNKEEPER: Your spare time?! You knights are incredible!

YOU: That's right.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 3]
YOU: Indeed. This will be my first task as a knight.

INNKEEPER: Your first task? Against a dragon?!
           Well, don't die out there! That's bad for business!

YOU: My king sent me on this task; I do not plan on failing him.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 4]
YOU: It is time for me to depart.

INNKEEPER: Farewell!

You step outside and retrieve your horse.
You are in the town square.
From here, you can see various stores along the perimeter of the square.
In the center is a large statue of a goddess worshipped by the villagers.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 6] Examine statue
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 5]
You step inside an armory. 
Swords, maces, lances, shields, helmets, and other shiny equipment line the shelves and walls.
A sleek steel sword catches your eye, but its price quickly makes you avert your gaze.
Unfortunately, you donâ€™t have enough coins to buy anything in here.
The king is only going to reward you after you have slain the dragon.
That sword is still in your mind though...
[Path-to 8] Persuade vendor
[Path-to 9] Return to town square


[Room 6]
You take a closer look at the statue, and you find that it resembles a woman you loved ages ago.
You remember how the dragon, Bushkin, ate her while you were away working, and how you decided to become a knight - to destroy every dragon you encountered.
You find yourself with a newfound vengeance, never more ready to slay a dragon in your life.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 7]
You set forth on your journey.
After hours of traveling, you find a small village.
[Path-to 13] Visit the village
[Path-to 14] Keep going


[Room 8]
YOU: Hello, sir!
     I'm about to slay the most dangerous dragon to step foot in this land.
     I will need your best sword to accomplish that.
     
You point at the sword you were eyeing.

VENDOR: Ah, yes. That's a nice sword, isn't it?
        It's going to cost you 50 gold coins.

YOU: Sir, I don't think you understand.
     I'm about to slay the deadliest dragon, Trumpkin.
     If I fail, it will come here and destroy this village as we know it.

VENDOR: Really now? Dragons don't usually come this far inland.
        I can't just give you this sword; a man needs gold to stay in business, you know.
        But it'll be a shame to see a knight like yourself become dragon food.
        Take this apple, it'll hold you over on your journey.

You begrudgingly accept the apple.
[Path-to 10] Leave the store

You take a closer look at the statue, and you find that it resembles a woman you loved ages ago.
You remember how the dragon, Bushkin, ate her while you were away working, and how you decided to become a knight - to destroy every dragon you encountered.
