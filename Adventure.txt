[Room 1]
Your eyes open as the sound of the rooster's cry echoes through the sky.
It's morning.
Feeling well rested, you grab your stuff and leave the bedroom.

INNKEEPER: Good morning, sir. Today's the big day, right?
           I heard the king hired you to vanquish some foul beast.
           A dragon, was it?
           Those are quite fearsome... and dangerous!

YOU: Is that so?
[Path-to 2] Arrogant response
[Path-to 3] Humble response


[Room 2]
YOU: I kill dragons in my spare time.
     Getting a bit of gold from it is just a bonus.

That was a lie.
The truth is, you were only recently knighted; the king sent you to kill a dragon as your first duty.

INNKEEPER: Your spare time?! You knights are incredible!

YOU: That's right.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 3]
YOU: Indeed. This will be my first task as a knight.

INNKEEPER: Your first task? Against a dragon?!
           Well, don't die out there! That's bad for business!

YOU: My king sent me on this task; I do not plan on failing him.
[Path-to 4] Leave the inn


[Room 4]
YOU: It is time for me to depart.

INNKEEPER: Farewell!

You step outside and retrieve your horse.
You are in the town square.
From here, you can see various stores along the perimeter of the square.
In the center is a large statue of a goddess worshipped by the villagers.
[Path-to 5] Check open stores
[Path-to 6] Examine statue
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 5]
You step inside an antique store. 
And you see that the store is filled with weapons, such as different types of swords and shields.
You don’t have enough coins to buy the sword you know will greatly help you win. 
The king is only going to reward you after you slay the dragon.
[Path-to 8] Try to bribe the vendor
[Path-to 9] Go back to town square


[Room 6]
You take a closer look at the statue, and you find that it resembles a woman you loved ages ago. You remember how the deadly dragon, Bushkin, ate her while you were away working, and how you decided to become a knight, and destroy every dragon you encountered. You find yourself with a new found vengeance, and you have never been more ready to slay a dragon in your life.
[Path-to 7] Leave village


[Room 7]
You set forth on your journey. After hours of traveling, you find a small village.
[Path-to 10] Find a place to sleep
[Path-to 11] Keep going


[Room 8]
YOU: Sir, good Sir. I’m about to slay the most dangerous dragon to step foot in this land, and I’m going to need your best sword to accomplish that. 

VENDOR: It’s going to cost you 50 gold coins.

YOU:Sir, I don’t think you understand. I’m about to slay the deadliest dragon, Trumpkin. If I fail, it will come here and destroy this village as we know it.

VENDOR: Oh my. You are a very brave knight! Unfortunately, I can’t just give you the sword you want, but I can give you this apple to hold you over on your journey.

You begrudgingly accept the apple.

[Path-to 9] Leave the store


[Room 9]
You are back at town square.
