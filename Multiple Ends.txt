[Room 1]
You are walking home after a long day of work.
A man in a mask jumps out from behind a trashcan, waving a knife at you.
Man: "Hand over your wallet!"
What will you do?
[Path-to 2] Ignore him
[Path-to 3] Give him the wallet
[Path-to 4] Defend yourself


[Room 2]
You decided to ignore him.
This angers him and he stabs you.
It hurt, but you continue to ignore him and walk away.
THE END


[Room 3]
You handed over your wallet, which contained nothing anyway.
Man: "Hey, this is empty!"
How will you respond?
[Path-to 4] Defend yourself
[Path-to 5] Not my problem


[Room 4]
You recall your elite close quarters combat training.
With a single punch, you remove the man's head from his body.
THE END


[Room 5]
You: "That's not my problem."
You turn around and walk away, without your empty wallet.
The man stares at you in silence as you casually distance yourself from him.
THE END
